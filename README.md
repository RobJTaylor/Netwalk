# Netwalk
## This is a second year Android project.
Netwalk is a re-implementation of the classic "pipes" game. The generation algorithm was supplied by Bournemouth University, but the rest of the design/code was completed by myself. Some of the assets are a little rough around the edges (I'm no graphic desinger), but it should run just fine.
