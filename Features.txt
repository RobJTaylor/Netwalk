Features:
	- Two icon sets (classic - regular netwalk. Prototype - the images I used when prototyping the game).
	- Random scramble - the game has a 1 in 100 chance to scramble during gameplay, this is to prevent the player from spam rotating,
	  making them think about theur choices (can be toggled in settings).
	- Settings page which allows toggling icon packs and random scramble.
	- Multiple difficulties (easy, medium and hard).
	- Custom game - allows user to specify how many rows and columns they wish to have.
	- Game over activity with total taps the user made.
	- How to play and About activities.
	- Very basic compensation for when device is rotated (cell width and height is calculated) - it doesn't look pretty but it works.
	- Check for grid completion based on original grid before scrambling.
	- App icon and logo.

Differences between implementation and design:
	- Animations - did not make it into the game.
	- Dark theme - I decided to use the standard Material theme instead, it's more pleasing.
	- Timer - I ended up not implementing a timer due to the introduction of custom games - it would be silly to have a 90 second
	  timer on a 100 x 100 grid.
